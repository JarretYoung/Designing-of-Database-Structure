##Database Structure Design 

A small team was put together to design a database given some specifications. Based on specifications provided in 2 separate stages and iterations, the team was tasked to come up with an efficient and logical database structure to properly store specific data. As there were 2 releases of specifications, the process was completed twice; once per assignment

1st Release:
Based on specifications given, a conceptual model for the database was created. This was then followed by logical model.

2nd Release:
Based on thespecification given, a follow up (update to the 1st Release's Products) was done where normalisation was performed on information of data to be collected, this was then followed by the updating of the conceptual and logical database models. Finally, the databse design was completed on Oracle SQL Developer.
